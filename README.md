# SEB Mini-project
##Brain Storming Phase 
1. Select an idea 
2. Attach any reading 
3. Decide on a model

##Coding Phase
1. Base Code (We should aim to have this done/found a repo which does this before we even start seb week)
2. Analysis Code (this can be started on base code, we can do this in R and i can do any reformatting of data in python - to turn things into pretty data frames)
3. The altered base code (we can do this along side the analysis code, once we have a pipeline for analysis going this can then be an easy iterative process)
