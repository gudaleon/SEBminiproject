# SEB Mini-project
## Research Phase
## Coding Phase 
## Quick thing on how to use git 
### how to push to git 
* git add < file.name > 
* git commit  -m '< message > '
* git push 
  
### how to pull from git 
* cd SEBminiproject (from your home directory)
* git pull 

### If it doesn't let you do either of those things there is probably a conflict
* do a diff by typing git diff 
* enter the files it says are conflicted and remove the conflict/resolve the conflict 
* do a git merge 
* then do a git pull
* git push
